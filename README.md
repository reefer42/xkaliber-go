# xkaliber-go
legion go xkaliber os 
so to start off this is a os i made for desktop that i use daily for couple years now still minor bugs and thats on the legion go 
i did my best with what i know how todo and im kinda throwing in the white flag if anyone else wants a unique debian for lego 
and has the experience to solve the remaining bugs have at it. (it is daily use capable no issues occur while gaming and only real issue occurs when the 
mouse cursor is moved and displayed out side that me personally im cool with it dont bother me.

features ok so i have no build script this was made a while ago no idea where the sht is but off top my head this has

ROCM DRIVERS MY BOY ALREADY IN HERE YO

WAYDROID AND IF FOR SOME REASON DOESNT LAUNCH JUSTO TYPE sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq

POP SHOP i didnt want just another debian wanted something more unique and how this store was
added isnt traditional as you can do everything from pop shop that includes the host u can literly 
depend on pop as thats what i intended it be here for

LOCAL DNS CACHE SERVER alot of people complain about net speeds and lantencys so i targeted a major player in this problem by removing the need
to on-goingly make these hand shakes and authentications use cache tokens of the previuis engagment which means a good of bit of bandwidth will no longer 
(waist the time to reach out over the internet by using locally stored keys thus improving networks speeds all around in all factors

has 4 optional preinstalled desks that are selectable from the login screen and plasma mobile is the dedcated desktop this was tailored to support just fyi

i removed old firmware-amd-graphics witht the latest in trixie and still didnt fix flicker

the keyboard in plasma mobile works fully system wide and not half @$$ like other systems

docker is imnstalled u have to systemctl enable it and do the command for permissions of users

tdp not added i was going to but had an issue getting it to fully support so i removed it.

this uses old skool seperated wayland and xserver sesssions because in my opinion wayland aint there yet so i rather swithc to x11 desktop for things like vr etc

THIS IS A LIVE ISO WHICH ALL THIS WAS BUILD AS X ROOT AS ITS SIMPLER IN MY OPINION SO BEING THERES NO SCRIPT THE ONLY METHOD THATS CONVEINENT AND IS METHOD I HAVE USED IS CUBIC

https://github.com/PJ-Singh-001/Cubic

FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW CUBIC IS A SHORTCUT FOR BUILDING A OS IF ALL YOUR SKILLS MOSTLY CONSIST OF POWER USER STYLE DEVELOPEMENT THIS IS FOR YOU IT WILL HAND THE CONTAINER U JUST CODE

id be willing to continue this if i had assistance but for now yall have at it . discord: ERPlegend 

PS DO NOT ASSOCIATE ANY SCRIPT FROM OTHER BRANCHES OR PROJECTS HERE U WILL BREAK XKALIBER . 
AS LONG AS YOU NEVER APT DIST-UPGRADE NOTHING SHOULD EVER GO WRONG WITH THIS SYSTEM

this the updated image with rocm and my attempt to replace firmware-amd-graphics with current trixie version :


to modify the dns cache server
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

discover n other markets are also there but everything as whole will show in pop shop to elaborate this isnt a distrobox not sure wtf i did it was long ago but debian and ubuntu using a shared co-dependant appstream and as long as this remains book worm there should be no issues and i personally used this for serveral years now and the original system was actually based on kali linux which do i have some scripts kali specific to install and setup non kali traditional things like steam gaming etc
